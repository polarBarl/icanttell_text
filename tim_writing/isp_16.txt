as i'm sure you've noticed i don't capitalize a damn thing. only when i want to emphasis an idea for that moment, that event envelope, do i choose to give it some exception. this is not due to a lack of respect, but due to my way of thinking which is probably why it's so unpopular among those i have toasty late night conversations with. i put everything on an even playing field. it's my way of gaining some sort of perspective in this world. when i talk about god or when i talk about dance clubs, they both get the same treatment. to me they should be looked at almost exacly the same. what are the pros and cons? what do you lose by going to church? what do you lose by going to a rave? i'm sure there are people out there who would experience healing from going to church, but i'm also positive that there are people who describe the same effect after dancing for hours in a crouded and violently lit room while under the influence of a few strict beers. i've met both. i've been both. so why should someone be offended for my lack of uppercase mentality? this is not to say that everything in my mind is flat, far from it. it's a reward system. my close friends for example hold such high esteem because they earned it. it might not have taken them much effort, but that's not the currency of my mind. i will love some people regardless of what they have done to me. but i'll still spell their name in minuscule, the same way i spell mine.
