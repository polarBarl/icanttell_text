think.

those golden moments when you work on something because you genuinely want to do it are important to hold onto. they are the very "germ" of the illusive impulse motivation. these  moments are not to be over critisized, however, such as the simple artist simply making things for their own productions and solutions. it may be all about the act of un-dwelling on the subject of inspiration. over complicating an idea can lead to it's premature collapse and eventually that idea (or event) becomes part of a hesitation cycle that slowly saps gumption from your mind and body. frustration insues and i'm starting to sound like a psychology 101 textbook, which i fucking hate.
