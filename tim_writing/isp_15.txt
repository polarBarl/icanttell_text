i'm going to smoke this tree out. he's got nowhere to run, i've got him cornered. i'm going to smoke on this until it clogs all of him and he sofocates. i'm going to break him down cell by cell. the vacuoles will cease to function and burst; releasing all of the stored waste into the cytoplasm > expending the energy needed to keep the nucleus alive > pressure of the central vacoule will fail. the cell walls begin to collapse in on the vunerable organelles, puncturing everything vital. ribosomes die off and allow the proteins in RNA to fray and split; one of the rare keys to life is lost. the cells are dying and it's because of me. i bring death to an unseen world and the power feels good. i don't stop. the leaves burn on the branches and fall as embers. i take another draw and the roots shrivel and unearth themselves. the pillar - cracking, brittle, seedless husk - dashes towards the ground. he's being bolted to the floor. there is no recoil - no bounce. he- it stays down. it's dead. done-zo. the others back away from me. they know what i'm capable of. no tree will stand in my way again. 

there is no cigarette between my fingers. there is no smoke. there is no tree. i never left my room.
