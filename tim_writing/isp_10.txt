[senses the growing tension]

b: "just playstation."


i like to make sandwiches with smoked fish and eat them outside with a seasonal brew and some company. not too many people, just enough. just enough so that you can still have those silences when everyone is just eating and concentrating on feeding their bodies. calories are so valuable. the care needed to create a meal is a wonderful way of slowing things back down again. grounding yourself, even. i don't think it's okay that most days i don't have a lot of time to fix a meal for myself. i have to sacrifice time spent sleeping to make a quality meal. something that involves ingredients grown and picked at home. i know that i'm going to grow food in my life. i know that i'm going to tear up my parents lawn and build them a garden. maybe raised beds, so the zoysia won't grow into the flowers or the strawberries. 

trees are pillars and that's where we got the idea from. it's one of those moments where the veil is lifted for a brief duration and you get to see the world for what it really is. the trees are holding up the canopy, your ceiling, and it's so obvious. the cathedral mimics this and so does atlas in the royal palace of amsterdam. bearing the weight of our orb until the end. a mere few months for the trees. the seasons brush the snow out the their branches and they stretch in the warmth. 

i wonder if i'll ever know that satisfaction.
