let the spiders live.

it's not karma, a mere mentioning of the idea makes me feel the other way. but i do believe in life - in it's purest form. i know that there's nothing i can do to keep them from sharing my home, so i don't bother looking for them, hunting them down in a clearly unsportsman-like tournament. it's like finding something that's been in front of your face for years and just now realizing it. i find a cup, trap them, then let them go. the kid who kills ants for fun, is really just a kid, but there's something wrong about myself partaking in the pleasures of putting out lights in this world. can a spider do wrong? has a spider ever extinguished a life for no reason? there are no records to support such a theory. we are the most dangerous motherfuckers on this planet and it's because we are complex enough and comfortable enough to have something go terribly wrong. simplicity would have saved so many. but how can we say that growing is bad? look at what we've accomplished...
