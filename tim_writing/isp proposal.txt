what we're thinking is that we'd like to do some research, and we'd like to publish that research, and maybe even get credit for said research.

we've already produced one small publication in that same vein that we can show you and expalin how things will be the same or how they will be different. we already have ideas for future topics and have started writing for some of them. the publications will be simple, and available for free to share. the idea is that they are based on very personal and fundamental values and opinions that we are discussing in order to provoke what i have heard Daniel Kahneman label as "slow thought." to give a list of topics, i think, would be inaccurate however, since they serve only as a launch point for a discussion and are meant to be dynamic. our first product, could be labeld as an inquiry into the values of the family and tradition, in fact, we titled it as such, but this was more to provide an abstract in which to partially inform the reader as to the publications direction, as subtitles often do. 

bing bang boobitie bobbitie.
