observation has driven me to think about the underlying form. i see someone on their bike, riding to class, and i don't like how they're on top of their bike. you know what i mean; the kind of bike that's either too small for them or the frame has poor geometry. the person literally looks like they're sitting atop their velocipede when you slow down to really look at it, and it looks goofy as all hell. to top things of, they're in such a low gear that their legs make thirty revolutions to every three yards gained on the pavement. it really makes them look like they have no idea what they're doing. whenever i see them, i think about what it is for me to ride my own bike. i built it with the help of a friend who had (and still has) far more knowledge and tools for the task than i did. the frame is nearly perfect for me. the way i have the seat and the drops; i'm sitting right between the wheels and well over the handle bars. it's quick and light. i'm not sitting on top of my bike; i'm sitting in it. it's a great feeling to lean with your vehicle, cut from a flat sheet of fiber glass.

sometimes i'd rather walk, though. it let's me slow down and think about where i am and where i'm going. i think i'll live where there's soil. something that will cool my feet when i tread barefoot across the earth. somewhere i can read and write without having to show anyone. somewhere where there's no pressure, just the breeze and plant matter knocked loose by it's recklessness. somewhere in this forest is a massive game of chess that's being played. it's lasted as long as the tallest trees and i visit it every day. it's not of stone, but something like opal. at each of the pieces cores is a grain of sand that aggrevated some good sported oyster. the talismans perform their waltz over the ages and i get to watch. i'll never get tired of this.
