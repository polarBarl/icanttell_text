just two cups, please.


i bought two cups earlier, just two. i think that has a lot to say about the kind of person i am. they are tea cups. so i was thinking about having tea in them when i bought them. so i was thinking about having tea with another person when i bought them. so my idea of tea is reflected in that purchase. so when i was deciding on the quantity of cups that i wanted, a few factors came into mind. one of them being the cost of several cups. another the practicality of any number of cups. and the last and most influential, was who would be using said cups. the decision took very little time, but the germ of the choice is something very deeply rooted in my person. when i think of having tea, i view it as an experience with another single being. it's an intimate event involving someone and myself. for me (and most likely not for you) this is a very telling statement about my social behavior. something inthralling, such as having an early morning tea session with another person, has a certain quality about it in my eyes. that is the quality of "the only conversation worth having." you know, the moments that you should only save for late night drunk escapades with a stranger. the one's that drive people away during the day. it's an event horizon, one that you should keep on check, because no one wants to talk to someone who takes the world too seriously. it's the age of fuck-its and everyone knows it.
