we need to work in places that make sense. these hollow calcium deposits of old and long dead coral reefs do nothing for me. we should make the great escape together, you and i. we could volunteer on farms. the ones that grow inpatient and destroy themselves from the inside out. the grass in perfect to lay in, but then there are bugs and bird shit and many are allergic to grass so they'll be all itchy later or worse. if i show up to your house sweaty, i'll be all gross and you won't want to hug me and then things will degrade and i'll leave early. i should have just driven. all the windows that i've had always face another wall.

cultural epicenters and markets, teeming with interesting people who care. they live in the city, but they frequently leave it to go do what they do. some climb, others fish or kayak. i'm sure that there's a balance here that most of us miss. we program in the mountains and film in the wet grass. that cabin that i dream of will of course have wifi, but it will be invisible. what you will see are shelves and shelves of books from my life. tomes of experience and presence. they are there because they couldn't hide themselves like my internet can. i blend the thought of my father's office into the coniferous grain of my home and it gives me direction. wind, rain and the cool earth will be there for me to bury my thoughts in: roots that should make me happy.
