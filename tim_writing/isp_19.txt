there's this imaginary hair, somewhere on my body. it's not one of my hairs, or maybe it is, but it's not rooted anywhere in my skin. it's constantly moving around to different location of my person. there are times when i can feel it, even times when i can see it, but i can never grab it. and then it disappears, like it was never there. but i'm so sure that i saw it. that it bent in the micro breeze and pressed against skin just enough to set off a nerve. it was there. 

i feel something. something on my hand. on the curve of the first digit of my thumb. it's him. it's the fucking hair, i know it. i take my time. this is a rare oppurtunity. it's set up camp somewhere where i can study it up close. i put my pen down and take a breath. i move my head and my arm together so that they're moving to a common vertex in space, an imaginary rendevous point. stopping the docking manuever so that the suspected hair location is an espresso mugs distance from my eyes, it spot the damn thing. a shout raises in my chest, as i begin my celebration, but something stops me. as i look closer at the hair, it's something entirely different than what i first saw. of course it still resembles a hair about 18cm in length, but it's qualities are not that of a hair. it's not there like a solid object would be, with defined limits to it's being. as if i were looking at a 3d film without the proper dual hue glasses, the hair is off register. as if captured by three perspectives not properly aligned. i examine. it's vibrating, but there's an order. the natural frequncy of the hair is there, just barely. it's communitcating in pulses. it's molecules are shaking as often as it's dna is instructing it to, creating heat and energy. this thing is alive? i look at the blurred egdes of the anomaly and find a very defined center. it's a vacuum. not even light is getting out. black doesn't come close. it's a void. it's a 18cm long vibrating void that's trying to talk to me.
