what are the chances of connecting with others? given the number of people on this planet, it sometimes seems rare that you can find and share values with others. that's not necessarily a bad thing; variation is essential for progress. but how can one define social progress? being open minded, accepting, cooperative? a lot of these traits support mass progression and group dynamics, but what about the self? is there anything more to being and the awareness of being that contributes the the overall social experience? 

being an introvert, its easy for one to partition a vast majority of one's thought on self and the dwelling of the self. spending most the one's time engaged in some form of internal contemplation that eventually carries over into time better spent asleep and permiating to the surface, affecting one's outward appearance and public opinion as well. one's thoughts meander while the vessel moves between each vertex of the day, and know one notices. until these ideas are "published" on the internet, no one wants to know. self publishing has changed self preservation, maybe even collapsed it. true enough that no one is forcing it on people, but i has become an outlet. there's no one specific person to talk to anymore. you yell at the expanding volume of data and if you're interesting enough, someone will get back to you. clever programmers have even developed artificial social responses that others can access, by directing the thrust of their angst jets at a particular bot, designed, not even to listen, but to project a hollow response in return. 

there are issues with these mindsets; they don't get you anywhere. once these patterns are recognized, one must either live above them, or attempt to change them.
