we've all come for the same reason, but we can't remember what it was. not that it's important anymore, it's just kinda how these kind of things happen, right? we have to prove that we're in love just to be told it's not about proving anything. i work out - you make wonderful food. i draw - you paint. i touch - you talk. i'm tired of this and you can tell. i'm tired of probing the surface of the greatest of planets to find out that there's no possibility for life, or that i'll never actually know, or that no one cares anymore. out of sight, out of mind. you people disgust me and i'm leaving.

i'm back and it's not because i like you. it's because i'm going to use you. everything that i pretend to enjoy about you is just so i can gain ground in this world because that's what these relationships are for. 

	p: "sometimes it's nice to have someone at your distance to talk to"

	h: after a long pause and some contemplation: "fuck you."

i can make use of the numbers i get at work. there's the royalty of it. princesses in every color and they come down here to have a good time and smile at the stable boys. it's not american to tell someone "i like you," so you know who they are. i tell some one my age and they give me some dap like they respect me more for it. on average, five people ask me if i'm okay a night. total strangers.
