in the future, the kids will steal the police cars, and the cops will lose their authority. the children will race them high in the sky streets of tomorrow and the banner of blue and red flashing lights will represent our rebellion against ourselves. they will race and crash the cruisers. they're high performance ships, but they can always take another. they don't care about the dangers. there's too many people now anyway that they'd be helping the cause if they died, so no one complains about the constant threat of a police vehicle flying through the 89th level of a small office building. clean up is something that pays. they crash them on purpose. they believe that it will save them or send them away from this hell, like in chuck's rant. they ride, blaring the sirens and streaming the lights. they fill the tunnels in the sky with those blinding colors. using these machines, they have escaped the normal life that allows for such games. they do what they want, they know they won't live longer than twenty or so so they've experienced every thing by the age of fifteen. it has made them wise, and also reckless. disease spreads among them and they've become outcasts. they don't mind. they take to the skies above the cities and bend metal around each other. at those speeds, you don't feel a thing.
