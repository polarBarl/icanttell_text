what if we did this:

we make an urban planning initiative that encompasses all outdoor spaces (for starters). we make part of being a citizen something that has to be earned. among other things, as citizens, we must be garden and flora literate. all who are to be included in our society must be learned in the ways of growing and sustaining plant-life. now, as in the great depression, jobs were made by expanding the US' railroad system, here they could be made by transforming the areas that we inhabit everyday. this doesn't mean changing every public space into a park, the point is to strive for an integrated urban environment. 

why do this? because we're humans, and as humans we need to be in touch with the earth in order to be healthy, and of course, happy. 

this will not make society any less productive. many will rise to meet this challenge and produce solutions to an efficient system in which to lay the foundation of such a transition. hopefully, one of the side-effects of this is it's effect on the pace of life. we should aim to slow our days down in order to enjoy them. this doesn't mean slacking off or spending all day gazing at the sky, this is about space. if we have an integrated area, it will be far more spread out than that of an old, "underdeveloped" space. traveling times will be different, traveling methods will hopefully change as well and everyone will be involved. we would finally be designing for ourselves, with is the most fulfilling way of building. communities would strengthen and maintenance will continue. think about the likely-hood of you picking up trash in someone else's yard as opposed to your own. 

i know this is not a very original idea, and it has many flaws and may even be extremely short-sighted, but what if everyone had a garden to walk through. a garden that you're not visiting, but inhabiting.
