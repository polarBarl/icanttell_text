i lower myself each day, to the teachings of this life. i grow or don't grow and because i'm in here and not out there it has worked for me. between the thames and the styx, we go. i'm tired of thinking about it. i'm tired of thinking about her. i do the work, and i fulfill my end, but it only takes me farther out. away from the warm beds and bookshelves of the mountains and into the steam of jungles. the wood crumbles and decays too fast here to build. we are always waiting. nothing to do but wait for the next job. and when it comes, we wait for the next. white turns to grey and grey to ash. no more fair skinned dreams of faraway people. it was our decision to come her in the first place, so with no one to blame we set fire to the towns. pillage and burn our way up river until there's no more oxygen. we've suffocated ourselves. we are undone. the last of the tourists have gone and now the great satellite stares down on us, ready to purge hell of it's captors. we are young, but we've broken the rules, and now we must pay for what we've done. maybe the next cycle will learn from this if there's anything left of us.
