isp_04.1

probably should have started labeling these earlierâ€¦

this is an expansion on isp_01

this "imaginary friend" of yours, of course, is an 'a posteriori' entity [meaning that it is based on some experience and your idea in formulated post-experience]. so you have this idea of what your IF is because of previous time spent with the host person from which the IF is based off of. so to you, the IF is an accurate representation of the host. funny thing about people is that when things tend to happen gradually, we take less notice of the changes involved. so as we spent more and more time away from the host, our IF gradually starts to stray away from reality and ironically become 'a priori' [or not based on experience]. this means that the majority of the dynamics in such a relationship are not being contributed by the other party, but my the IF's creator. through personal experiences and internal struggles one's perception changes and ultimately that affects one's IF, since the IF is essentially a projection of values on your mind. the values become skewed and your interpretation of the IF loses it's accuracy, as does your interpretation of the host. time is dependent factor is a process like the degradation of one's perspectives; the longer you have to let the reality of short interactions with the host and the deranged values of the IF smear together the farther from the truth you seems to find yourself. 

but then something very simply beautiful happens; you get to be with the host again. there are no fantasies. no perceptions of what this person is really like. no guess work. they are truly there, and based on how authentic that person is, there is no longer knowing, there is, again, simply being. that may be part of the beauty of it: the simplicity. how easy it is to fall back into the life you leave every time you leave reality for the lie that encompasses your IF. this is what makes the illusions worth-while. the instants that they are shattered.
