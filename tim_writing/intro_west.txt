SO HEREâ€“GOES: this is our second attempt at building something. something that we would like to see change hands many times over. something that we hope could get others thinking. we don't particualrly give a two shades of a darn about what it is you decide to think about. shoot, perhaps after a brief jaunt through our little book, all you want to think about is the next opportunity you'll get to indulge in expressly fruity libations containing inconsistent proportions of alcohol; fine by us. regardless, we hope to slow down your day for the very short duration that it will take for you to enjoy this tiny tome we've put together. heck, we might even inspire something creative and athentic [brief moment of picturing vast tracks of land, all stary-eyed, thumbs securely fixed underneath straps of suspenders just around nipple height. "we've done it." he expelled. "we've saved the ranch."]. the writing is ours (unless noted other-wise) and many of them are responses to prior entries. in other words, the collection of writing is a conversation between the two of us. a conversation that we would love to see continued outside of the angst and sarcasm of our cockamamie orifices. cheers.
