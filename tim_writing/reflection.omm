I'm sure we've all had those moments; when people unknowingly describe what took you a weekend, a semester, a college career to accomplish in a very short and unimpressive sentence. Gives one perspective. Moving on.

Maybe I should shave my head, or paint my face so that everyone knows that I'm taking this seriously. Mohawks and tomahawks. When's the last time you had something worth fighting for? Legs used to be important because you needed them to get around - now look at you. Dance around the fire, wear what you kill, dirty has nothing to do with dirt. What?! They aren't made to last?! No more tools. No more learning. No more danger. I don't think you get it. That's why I shaved my head. Because this is important. Because I'm going to war for this. Mohawks and tomahawks.

I DON'T FUCKING UNDERSTAND IT. WHAT HAVE I WE BEEN DOING?

I'm leaving because I think you're an asshole. Sorry. I mean bitch.
